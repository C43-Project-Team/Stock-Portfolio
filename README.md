# Stock-Portfolio

Notes For Submission:
- ER Diagram can found at `./documentation/StockMS ER Diagram.pdf`
- Relevant information about our database `functions`, `triggers`, and `procedures` can be found in `./documentation/database_reference/`.
- Our queries can be found in the `backend/src/database` directory. However, we used Kysely, a type-safe query builder that has an (almost) 1-1 mapping to SQL. We recommend checking out `documentation/database_reference/DBQueryReference.md` instead, where we assembled all of our queries (as the raw SQL equivalent).
